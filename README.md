N/B: I am taking a break to focus on preparing my talk for [droidconKenya](https://droidcon.co.ke/).

## Weekly Challenges

Just a random repo, containing projects I use to practice programming concepts by building tools from scratch.

Every weekend, I will try to finish a project.

## Projects

1. [Json Parser](https://github.com/kibettheophilus/weekly-challenges/tree/master/json-parser) - [WIP]

:information_source: Most projects are picked from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) but I will also work on random ideas I come across.
