## Weekly Challenges
Just a random repo, containing projects I use to practice programming concepts by building tools from scratch.

Every weekend, I will try to finish a project.

## Projects 
1. Json Parser


:information_source: Most projects are picked from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) but I will also work on random ideas I come across.
